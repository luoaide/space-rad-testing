This setup was created by Kyle King (D/EECS) and CDT Haley Duke to support a D/PANE project.

First, make sure your Pi has the correct time:

sudo timedatectl set-ntp false
sudo timedatectl set-timezone EST
sudo timedatectl set-time "2018-04-18 14:10:00"

To make the software run automatically at boot, you'll need copy rc.local to the /etc/ directory:

$ sudo cp /media/noobs/RADIATION/rc.local /etc/

When the Pi boots, it will check for /boot/RADIATION/COLLECTDATA. If that file exists, then it will do a few things:

1. It will wait for 1 minute to give you time to set up. The green LED will be dark for that minute.
2. It will start collecting data after a minute. The green LED will heartbeat while it is collecting.
3. It will record the Pi temperature every 10 seconds to /media/noobs/RADIATION/results/TIME-temp.log
4. It will run a memory test against 500 MBs of RAM and save the results to /media/noobs/data/TIME-mem.log
5. The green LED will turn off when it is done.

The temp and mem scripts that collect data are in /media/noobs/RADIATION/
