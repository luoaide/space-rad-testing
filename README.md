# space-rad-testing

This repository is part of research project at the United States Military Academy sponsored by the PaNE Department. This project encompasses testing consumer off-the-shelf hardware (COTS Hardware) for durability in radiation environments. The goal of this research is to enable the use of cheaper, higher-performing CPUs such as the Raspberry Pi 3B+ and Raspberry Pi Compute Module in low-earth orbit satellites.

### Terminology
TID: Total Ionizing Dose    
SEU: Singal Event Upset

# TID Test Structure
See folder.

# SEU Test Structure
The SEU test is obsolete in 2021 iteration of this research. The files in the SEU folder were produced by Kyle King (D/EECS) and CDT Haley Duke in 2018. Those tests are non-operational and not used in the 2021 iteration.
